            <h2>FROM HUMBLE ROOTS, WE GREW TO BE TOTALLY AWESOME</h2>
                <br/>
                <h3>How It All Started</h3>
                <p>We started this business in 2001 working nights and weekends from our kitchen table, welling Low-fat Candy for Goldfish and stumbling over dogs and cats sleeping under the table.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Growing Greater</h3>
                <p>With unprecedented demand for our products, we soon outgrew our table and moved to a storefront in an otherwise nondescript strip mall in Gary Indiana in 2003.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>The Catalog</h3>
                <p>When even that storefront couldn't keep up with demand, we started our paper catalog and shipped orders across the United States to our growing customer base of cool cats and daffy dogs.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>The Website</h3>
                <p>This website became our primary replacement for the paper catalog in 2005, and has been your source for Totally Awesome Stuff for nearly two decades.</p>
